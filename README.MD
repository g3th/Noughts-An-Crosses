# Noughts and Crosses
## Terminal game written in Kotlin

Project created for Hyperskill courses, written in Kotlin to be played in any terminal of your choice (i.e. Gnome).

Unfortunately cannot find an equivalent of list comprehension for Kotlin to iterate through some fot he lists in a single line, perhaps no such thing exists in the language.

It works but is probably too long and convoluted.
